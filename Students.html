      <h1>Students</h1>
      <p>The bee is important to the natural biodiversity of any country and also of the Netherlands, with around 30% of all our daily food relying on this insect. Students make Amsterdam buzz. And like the humble bee, the student population in Amsterdam is an important source of cultural and economic growth.</p>

      <h2>The International Student Network</h2>
      <p>The International Student Network (ISN) is an organisation that aims to help international students integrate into life in Amsterdam. They do this by organising many activities to help students meet and to help them make the most of their exchange. To participate in the activities you need to purchase an ESN card for €5, but this is nothing compared to the discounts you will receive. </p>

      <h3>Introduction week</h3>
      <p>Before the university semester begins, ISN organises an airport pick-up service for all international students. Buses take students to Science Park where they can pick up their house keys and register with the municipality of Amsterdam. During the rest of the week, several activities will be planned like ice skating, pub crawls, scavenger hunting and brunches. It is a great way for students to get to know each other and to get their first look at Amsterdam. In addition to this, ISN organises a final party at the end of semester to farewell the students.</p>

      <h3>Coco's outback</h3>
      <p>Every Wednesday night the ISN hosts a drinks party (borrel) for international students at Coco’s Outback, an Australian-themed pub on Rembrandtplein. There are cheap drinks and entry is free. What better way to entice students?</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Culture nights</h3>
      <p>There are several culture nights throughout the year and each night focuses on a different country or region. These nights are for Dutch students going on exchange and international students from those countries, but everyone is welcome. ISN hosts a range of these nights to help students share their cultures. Traditional food is eaten and there are guest speakers to enlighten the group</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Day trips</h3>
      <p>Throughout the year a series of day trips are planned. These trips are to other cities in the Netherlands and to other countries too. Trying herring in Volendam, eating waffles in Belgium, discovering the Netherlands’ politics in The Hague, and smelling tulips in Keukenhof, these are just a few of the trips ISN has organised. </p>

      <h3>Discover Holland weekend</h3>
      <p>There is an annual weekend trip to explore more of Holland. This trip uncovers the rich culture and nightlife of Groningen, the Wadden island of Schiermonnikoog, and the boat-filled waterways of Giethoorn. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Super trip</h3>
      <p>Each semester ISN organises a “Super Trip” to a few different cities. In the 2017 spring semester, they went through central Europe; to Vienna, Budapest and Bratislava. The trip was a huge success and was enjoyed by all. The group conquered 3 cities in 5 days, and although everyone was tired by the end it was well worth it. As well as the Super Trip, there are also smaller weekend trips planned throughout the year. You can visit the  <a href="http://www.isn-amsterdam.nl">ISN website</a> for more information or see page 115 of the guide!</p>

      <!-- Hoofdkop Student population -->
      <h2>Student population</h2>
      <p>Amsterdam has a sizeable student population. Together, the UvA and VU University Amsterdam have over 50,000 students. The Universities of Applied Sciences (hogescholen or hbo) combined have approximately 55,000 students. Economics is the most popular course for the hogescholen, while Behavioural and Social Sciences attract the most students at UvA and VU. </p>

      <h3>Higher education</h3>
      <p> There are two types of higher education institutions in the Netherlands, Universities and Universities of Applied Sciences. The latter prepares students for specific professions and tends to be more practically oriented than universities, which focus more on theory and generating knowledge through research. Generally speaking, an hbo degree provides its graduates with sufficient skills and knowledge to practise the profession they were trained for, without any additional training
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Bachelor or master</h3>
      <p> In the last decade, the system of higher education has been drastically reorganised to fit in with the British or American model. This means that a university education has been subdivided into a broader, three-year bachelor’s degree and a one-year master’s degree. At hogescholen the bachelor’s degree takes four years while in some cases graduates will be able to continue their studies for one or two years for a master’s degree. The aim of this European reorganisation is to make the system of higher education more transparent throughout Europe and to make it easier to study in another country </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Student facilities</h3>
      <p> All educational institutions try to provide all facilities necessary to enable their students to study to the best of their abilities. There are faculty libraries providing a quiet place for studying, computer rooms to work on papers and, of course, students can go to the departments with questions about the course programme or for help with a particular problem. If you are thinking about switching to another course, you could consult the student counsellor. Advice and information about course programmes is also available at the university information centre, where you can go with general questions or to make a personal appointment</p>

      <h2>Social contacts</h2>
      <p>A good balance between work and relaxation makes for better results in your studies. The more pressure you are under, the more important it is to unwind and relax. Fortunately, there are a million interesting ways to spend your free time</p>

      <!--Subkopjes Social contacts-->
      <h3>Student organisations</h3>
      <p>Hogescholen and universities have several clubs to keep students informed about course schedules and related subjects and to represent the students in decisions regarding the programme. Parties, trips and other social activities are sometimes part of the programme as well.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Student societies</h3>
      <p>To get to know people outside your own institute or field, you can join one of Amsterdam’s Dutch student organisations. These organise all kinds of activities, ranging from lectures and plays to parties. For most organisations, membership is required. The UvA together with the Hogeschool van Amsterdam (HvA) has a similar society for international students, called the International Student Network Amsterdam (ISN). The ESN section for Inholland University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam Diemen is called ESN Diemen. They will make you feel more at home in the Netherlands and help you make new friends. The general student union is the ASVA. They represent students’ interests at universities, hogescholen and in the political arena. They also organise courses, political debates and much more. You can always contact ASVA if you want to become an active member of the student union. For homosexual, bisexual< and transgender students<, A.S.V. Gay organises meetings and can serve as a safe space</p>

      <h3>ASDV Bonaparte office</h3>
      <p>ASDV Bonaparte is a student debating society that meets on Thursday nights between 08.00 pm to 01.00 am. If you would like them to organise an English language evening for you, send them an e-mail. Some universities have their own cafés, like Fest at Amstelcampus or the Hogeschool voor Economische Studies (HES) Café. These cafés have a great atmosphere and are good places to meet fellow students. Another reason to go there is the fact that they are usually not expensive</p>
