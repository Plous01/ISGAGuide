      <p>Student life can be stressful, but Amsterdam offers great amenities. For example, the city features a wide variety of urban jungle cafés. Urban in the sense that they have fantastic coffees, resourceful menus and free Wi-Fi, and jungly in the sense
        that they have a buzzing yet tranquil atmosphere. This chapter lists them below, but also guides you through other essentials about studying in Amsterdam.</p>

      <h2>Dutch language courses</h2>
      <p>If you have obtained the necessary preparatory diplomas in your country of origin and are planning to enrol in a Dutch course, you will need a certificate stating that you have sufficient Dutch language skills. Students in exchange programmes do
        not need this certificate, but of course some knowledge of the Dutch language makes it easier to enjoy your stay. Your university can tell you about Dutch language courses. Sometimes the institutions offer Dutch language courses. You can contact
        their websites for information. You can also start a Dutch language course on the internet. Go to <a href="http://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> and click on ‘Dutch’. It is a free resource with lessons varying from beginner’s tips to fun vocabulary.
        ISN Amsterdam offers 6 and 12 week courses where you will learn how to introduce yourself, how to ask for directions, and lots more. The 6 week course costs only €60, and the 12 week course costs €150, including a book called ‘Nederlands in Gang’.
        For more information, check <a href="http://www.isn-amsterdam.nl/dutch-lessons">their website</a>.
